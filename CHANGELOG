- Sync mutes with backend (SEE NOTE BELOW)

Pleroma will now try to get the current mutes from the backend. Sadly, a bug in
Qvitter will not allow getting the mutes from the endpoint, because it will
ignore HTTP Basic authentication. Mutes will still persist in Pleroma through
localstorage, but the mutes from Qvitter won't be picked up if the call fails.

The patch for Qvitter:
